# Random Forest vs Decision Tree (UCI Spambase)

This script compares the performance of a **single Decision Tree** and a **Random Forest ensemble** using the **UCI Spambase dataset**. It demonstrates how ensemble averaging improves generalization, evaluates training time and accuracy trade-offs, and visualizes model performance.

## Requirements
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn ucimlrepo

## Usage
python rf_vs_tree_spambase.py
